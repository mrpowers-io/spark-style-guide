# Spark Style Guide

Spark is an amazingly powerful big data engine that's written in Scala with different programatic APIs.

This repo contains style guides for the different APIs:

* [PySpark style guide](https://github.com/MrPowers/spark-style-guide/blob/main/PYSPARK_STYLE_GUIDE.md) for the Python API.
* [Spark Scala style guide](https://github.com/MrPowers/spark-style-guide/blob/main/SPARK_SCALA_STYLE_GUIDE.md).

This document draws on the Spark source code, the [Spark examples](http://spark.apache.org/examples.html), and popular open source Spark libraries to outline coding conventions and best practices.

Comprehensive Python/Scala/Java style guides already exist and this document focuses specifically on the style issues for Spark programmers.

Reader beware:

> Any style guide written in English is either so brief that itâ€™s ambiguous, or so long that no one reads it.
